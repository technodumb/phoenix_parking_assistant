# phoenix_parking_assistant

Phoenix Parking Assistant is a new and innovative parking facility designed by us, Proto Pheonix. We have integrated all the things you need while at a parking spot. It shows the available parking spots and by scanning a QR code, one of those unoccupied parking spots get assigned to the user. The location of the spot would be displayed and the car once parked will be protected. The user has to scan the QRcode next to their parking area to unlock the car, hence making it secure.
